# Code Refactor
  
  ## Description
  This project was used to demonstrate my ability to follow the SCOUT rule by refactoring existing code in HTML and CSS to include:

  - semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
  - accessible alt attributes for icon and image elements
  - heading attributes that fall in sequential order
  - a concise and descriptive title element
  - CSS selectors and properties that are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure of HTML elements
  - a CSS file that is properly commented
  - correctly functioning links
