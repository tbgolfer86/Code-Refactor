# Module1-Challenge - 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

This project was used to demonstrate my ability to refactor existing code in HTML and CSS to include: 

- semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- accessible alt attributes for icon and image elements
- heading attributes that fall in sequential order
- a concise and descriptive title element
- CSS selectors and properties that are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure
- a CSS file that is properly commented


# Usage
